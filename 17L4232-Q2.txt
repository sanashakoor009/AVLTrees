It is better to implement Associative Maps using AVL Tree than BSTree
because time complexity for AVL in most of the function is less than then time complexity BST.
Moreover we dont have to traverse whole data to reach required position in AVL Tree
Because tree contains the key value through which it is easy to reach that key in AVL.
